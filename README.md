# Pick_Plac_autom_siemens_S7-1500

In this automation, i have designed the wrote programme using siemens S7 and the Plc used S7 1500, for the visual HMI i have use TIA, the main objective is programme is that completed parts are fed along a conveyor that leads to a weight check station. The part is weighed and 
then either picked up or rejected. If the weight is in the 
appropriate range, a Pick and Place unit will pick up the part 
and place it into a case for shipping. The pick and place is 
equipped with a vacuum gripper that will carry the part to 
the case. If the weight is outside the appropriate range, the 
conveyor is tipped and the part slides into a reject bin.
